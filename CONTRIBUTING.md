## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin hacking on `reverse_argparse`, you'll need to do four things:

1. **Fork the Repository:**  On [`reverse_argparse`'s main page][homepage], in
   the top-right corner, you'll see a button to [fork the repository][fork].
   Do so, and then clone your fork and set it up with
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:${USER}/reverse_argparse
   cd reverse_argparse
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:sandialabs/reverse_argparse
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. **Set Up your Environment:**  Install the requirements with
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/reverse_argparse
   python3 -m pip install \
     -r requirements.txt \
     -r doc/requirements.txt \
     -r example/requirements.txt \
     -r test/requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Examples:**  Ensure you can run all the examples with
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/reverse_argparse/example
   ./run-all.bash
   ```
4. **Build the Documentation:**  Ensure you can build the documentation with
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/reverse_argparse/doc
   ./make-html.bash
   ```

[fork]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

### Pre-Commit

We use [pre-commit][precommit] to ensure adherence to Python best practices,
enforce our style guide, etc.  To set yourself up with it, ensure you have your
development environment activated, and then run
```bash
cd /path/to/reverse_argparse
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-push
```

[precommit]: https://pre-commit.com/

The checks we perform are the following:
* Use [commitizen][commitizen] to ensure commit messages match the
  [Conventional Commits specification][conventional].  Use the
  [Conventional Commits extension for VS Code][extension] (or something
  similar) to create commit messages that match the standard.
* Use [mypy][mypy] to run static type checking on our type-hinted code.
* Ensure no large files are added to the repository.
* Ensure files parse as valid Python.
* Check for files that would conflict in case-sensitive filesystems.
* Ensure files don't contain merge conflict strings.
* Ensure files end with a single blank line.
* Ensure we only use Unix line endings.
* Ensure test files are correctly named.
* Trim trailing whitespace.
* Ensure we use [type-hinting][typing].
* Check for common mistakes in [reStructuredText][rest] in our documentation.
* Use [black][black] to automatically format the code.
* Use [Bandit][bandit] to find common security issues.
* Use [doc8][doc8] to enforce our style for our documentation.
* Lint the code with [flake8][flake8].
* Use [isort][isort] to ensure `import` statements are sorted correctly.
* Use [prospector][prospector] to check for various errors, potential problems,
  convention violations, complexity, etc.  This uses the following tools under
  the hood:
  * [dodgy][dodgy]
  * [mccabe][mccabe]
  * [pycodestyle][pycodestyle]
  * [Pyflakes][pyflakes]
  * [Pylint][pylint]
* Use [pydocstyle][pydocstyle] to ensure our docstrings line up with
  [PEP 257][pep257].
* Use [pyroma][pyroma] to ensure our package complies with the best practices
  of the Python packaging ecosystem.

[unittest]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
[testplan]: https://github.com/morganstanley/testplan

#### Settings

After installing the various extensions, you'll also want to customize your
**Settings**.  Some things can be set in the [Settings editor][settings]:

[settings]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-editor

* Text Editor
  * Font
    * **Font Family:**  Add "'Hack FC Ligatured', " to the beginning of the
      list.  You'll also want to install the [Ligatured Hack fonts][hack] on
      your system.
  * Files
    * **Auto Save:**  Set to "onFocusChange".
    * **Trim Trailing Whitespace:**  Check.
* Extensions
  * Conventional Commits
    * **Show Editor:**  Check.
    * **Silent Auto Commit:**  Check.
  * coverage-gutters
    * **Coverage-gutters: Show Line Coverage:**  Check.
    * **Coverage-gutters: Show Ruler Coverage:**  Check.
  * Git
    * **Allow Force Push:**  Check.
    * **Autofetch:**  Set to "true".
    * **Enable Smart Commit:**  Check.
    * **Fetch On Pull:**  Check.
    * **Prune On Fetch:**  Check.
    * **Rebase When Sync:**  Check.  This makes it such that you use `git pull
      --rebase` when pulling.
    * **Show Push Success Notification:**  Check.
    * **Terminal Git Editor:**  Check.
  * pre-commit-helper
    * **Run On Save:**  Select "all hooks".

    * **Linting:  Bandit Enabled:**  Check.
    * **Linting:  Flake8 Enabled:**  Check.
    * **Linting:  Lint On Save:**  Check.
    * **Linting:  Mypy Enabled:**  Check.
    * **Linting:  Prospector Enabled:**  Check.
  * Python Docstring Generator configuration
    * **Docstring Format:**  Select "google-notypes".
    * **Start On New Line:**  Check.
  * Sourcery Configuration:
    * **Token:**  [Create a free Sourcery account][sourcery], generate a token,
      and paste it here.
  * Vim
    * **Vimrc:**  Enable:  Check.

[hack]: https://github.com/gaplo917/Ligatured-Hack
[sourcery]: https://sourcery.ai/

Other items can be customized in the [`settings.json` file][settingsjson].
Consider adding the following snippets:

[settingsjson]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settingsjson

* To use ligatures to make multi-character symbols in code more readable, add
  ```json
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  ```
* To add vertical rulers to the editor window, add
  ```json
  "editor.rulers": [
      72,
      79
  ],
  ```
  The line at 79 characters is to remind you of the maximum line length, and
  the one at 72 characters is to remind you of the maximum line length for
  comments and docstrings (see [PEP8][pep8]).
* To prevent VS Code from sending telemetry data off-site, add
  ```json
  "redhat.telemetry.enabled": false,
  ```
* If you'd like the UI to preserve the scope that you're currently editing at
  the top of the file as you scroll through it, you can add
  ```json
  "editor.experimental.stickyScroll.enabled": true,
  ```
* To turn on search highlighting when using the Vim extension, add
  ```json
  "vim.hlsearch": true,
  ```
* To set up `pytest`, such that it produces coverage information, add
  ```json
  "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
      "-v",
      "--cov",
      "--cov-report=html",
      "--cov-report=json",
      "--cov-report=xml",
      "."
  ],
  ```

[pep8]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length

A final setting needs to be configured in the [`launch.json` file][launchjson].
You'll need to add the following to the list of configurations:
```json
"configurations": [
    {
        ... # Existing configuration.
    },
    {
        "name": "Python: Debug Tests",
        "type": "python",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${file}",
        "purpose": ["debug-test"],
        "console": "integratedTerminal",
        "env": {
            "PYTEST_ADDOPTS": "--no-cov"
        },
        "justMyCode": false
    }
]
```
This will make it such that when debugging unit testing, the debugger doesn't
restrict itself to only your code.

[launchjson]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations

#### Choosing a Python Interpreter

Once you've taken care of all the settings above, you're almost ready to start
Python development with VS Code.  Before you do, though, you'll need to select
your Python interpreter.  Open the command palette, start typing "python
interpreter," and select **Python: Select Interpreter**.  It will pop up a list
of Python installations it could find on your system.  Pick the one that
corresponds to your development environment (see
[above](#setting-up-your-environment)).

#### Setting Up PyTest

The last step in setting up VS Code for Python development is to ensure
`pytest` is working.  Click on the flask icon on the left-hand side to open the
**TESTING** panel on the left.  There will be two collapsible sections labeled
**TEST EXPLORER**.  Collapse the top one (it comes from an extension that
doesn't quite work for Python testing), and expand the bottom one.  You should
be able to hover over a test file, click the play button, and see the tests
pass.  If so, go ahead and click the three dots at the top-right of the
**TESTING** panel and deselect the top **Test Explorer**.

Running your test suite will generate code coverage information, which you can
then view in the editor.  After you've run your tests, open up one of your code
files, open the command palette, type "coverage," and select
**Coverage-Gutters: Toggle Coverage**.  This will highlight covered and
uncovered lines in green and red, respectively.  You can also view the full
coverage report by opening `test/htmlcov/index.html`.

## Coding Standards

Many of our coding standards are applied and enforced using
[pre-commit][precommit] (see [above](#pre-commit)).  In addition to what's
handled automatically, we have the following.

### Documentation

Classes and functions should be documented with [docstrings][docstrings] using
the [Google-style][google] format.  The contents of docstrings should use
[reStructuredText][rest] formatting.  This is so we can use [Sphinx][sphinx] to
generate [our documentation][docs].  Additionally, function definitions should
utilize [type-hinting][typing] wherever possible for clarity's sake.

[docstrings]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257
[google]: https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings
[rest]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html
[docs]: https://reverse-argparse.readthedocs.io
[sphinx]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

### Testing

We use [pytest][pytest] for our unit test suite.  To get up-to-speed with what
it does and how it works, check out [this RealPython tutorial][tutorial].  Also
highly recommended is [Python Testing with pytest, by Brian Okken][okken].

[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/
[tutorial]: https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/
[okken]: https://www.amazon.com/Python-Testing-pytest-Effective-Scalable/dp/1680502409/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=pytest&qid=1637712723&sr=8-2

Please add tests to cover any new functions you create, and adhere to the
following guidelines:
* Each module (`module_name.py`) should have a corresponding test file
  (`test_module_name.py`).
* Each function/method in a module should have at least one corresponding test.
* The test order should match the ordering of the functions/methods being
  tested in the module, such that users can easily scroll through the two files
  side-by-side.
* Prefer parametrizing a test function over creating a separate test function.
* But don't go too crazy with that&mdash;use your judgment.
* Place any fixture definitions at the top of the test file.

### Best Practices

* Docstrings and comments should be grammatically correct English
  (capitalization, punctuation, full sentences, etc.).
* Prefer double quotes over single quotes.
* Use `pathlib.Path` and associated methods to represent all path-like objects.
* Use [f-strings][fstrings] for formatting strings.
* Alphabetize class attributes in the docstring and `__init__()` to ease
  readability/maintainability/extensibility.
* Prefer alphabetizing keyword arguments to functions, unless a different
  ordering would be more logical in a specific situation.
* Blank lines in functions should be avoided unless preceding a comment
  indicating a section of code.  However, if your function is broken up into
  sections via comments, consider subdividing it into smaller functions.
* Prefer imports of the form
  ```python
  from package import Class
  ```
  as opposed to
  ```python
  import package
  ```
  if only using a small handful of things from the package.

[fstrings]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/



## Creating Issues

Create [issues][issues] in GitHub for any work that needs to be done.

[issues]: https://github.com/sandialabs/reverse_argparse/issues

### Markdown

[Markdown][markdown] is a lightweight markup language with plain text
formatting syntax.  GitHub uses a form of it for rendering issue and pull
request descriptions and comments, wiki pages, and any files in your
repositories with a `.md` extension (such as this one).  For more details on
what's possible with GitHub-flavored Markdown, [see the documentation][gfm].

[markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
[gfm]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

### Issue Templates

When creating an issue, select one of the available issue templates, and then
follow the instructions that appear in the template.

### Labels

The [reverse_argparse > Labels][labels] page shows you all the labels we use,
along with their descriptions.  "Type" labels will be applied automatically
when an issue is created via the issue template.  "Stage" labels are used to
keep track of what work is being done at any given time.  Other labels can be
added as appropriate.

[labels]: https://github.com/sandialabs/reverse_argparse/labels



## Working Issues

### Planning Work

Depending on the needs of the `reverse_argparse` user base, a project
maintainer will schedule issues to be tackled in the near future by applying
the "Stage:  Soon" label.  An issue can then be grabbed by a member of the
development team when they have some time available to work on it.

> **Note:**  If you're working on something that hasn't been
> scheduled&mdash;e.g., you're tackling a quick bug fix, or are tinkering with
> a feature you'd like to see added&mdash;don't worry about the "Stage:  Soon"
> label; just work on it as per the rest of the guidelines below.

### When Work Begins

First switch the label from "Stage:  Soon" to "Stage:  Development".  Next make
sure your local `master` branch is up-to-date with
```bash
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only upstream master
```

> **Note:**  You should never be making commits on your `master` branch.  The
> `--ff-only` ensures you only update your local `master` branch if it can be
> fast-forwarded.

Once `master` is updated, you then create a feature branch off of it with
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

The recommended branch naming convention is to use the issue number, followed
by a hyphen, followed by the issue title, all lowercase, omitting special
characters, and replacing spaces with hyphens.  For instance, if issue number
123 has "Implement Awesome New Feature" as the title, the corresponding branch
name would be `123-implement-awesome-new-feature`.

### As Work Continues

Do whatever work is necessary to address the issue you're tackling.  Break your
work into logical, working commits.  Use either the
[Conventional Commit plugin for Pycharm][jetbrains] or the
[Conventional Commits extension for VS Code][vscode] (or something similar) to
ensure your commit messages adhere to the
[Conventional Commits specification][conventionalcommits].

[jetbrains]: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit
[vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits
[conventionalcommits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

Feel free to commit and push small chunks early and often and then use `git
rebase -i` to reorganize your commits before sharing.

> **Note:**  If you rebase a branch that's already been pushed to a remote,
> you'll wind up changing the history, which will require a force push with
> `git push origin +<branch-name>`.  That is permissible (even encouraged), but
> if you've had one or more reviewers or collaborators working with you on the
> branch, *get their buy-in first* before doing a force push.

### When Work is Complete

While working on your feature in your local `<branch-name>` branch, other
commits will likely make it into the upstream `master` branch.  There are a
variety of ways to merge these changes into your local feature branch.  One
possibility is
```bash
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only upstream master
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase master
```

though there are others that are equally valid.  Once all is well, create a
pull request (see below).

### Closing Old Issues

If at any point you encounter an issue that will not be worked in the
foreseeable future, it is worthwhile to close the issue such that we can
maintain a reasonable backlog of upcoming work.  Do be sure to include in the
comments some explanation as to why the issue won't be addressed.



## Pull Requests

The only way changes get into `master` is through pull requests.  When you've
completed work on an issue, push your branch to your fork with `git push -u
origin <branch-name>`, and then create a pull request.  Apply the same "Type"
label as the issue, and then return to the issue and swap "Stage:  Development"
for "Stage:  Review".

### Reviewers

A project maintainer will review your pull request.  Work with them to get your
changes into an acceptable state.

### Drafts

You may wish to have your changes reviewed by colleagues before they are ready
to be merged into `master`.  To do so, create a [draft pull request][drafts].
GitHub will not allow you to merge a draft request.  When it's ready for
review, you can [mark it as ready][ready].

[drafts]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests
[ready]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#marking-a-pull-request-as-ready-for-review

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions is GitHub's continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
mechanism.  The configurations for our workflows can be found in the `*.yml`
files in [the `.github/workflows` directory](.github/workflows) in the
repository root:
* **Continuous Integration:**  This workflow runs a `test` job, parametrized
  across the currently maintained versions of Python, to ensure unit testing
  passes, and a `commits` job to ensure we're adhering to the [Conventional
  Commits specification][conventional].
* **Semantic Release:**  This workflow runs on merges to `master` to
  automatically generate and publish new releases, based on the commits just
  merged.

In addition to the GitHub Actions workflows, we also integrate with the
following services:
* [Codecov][codecov]:  We calculate and publish code coverage details for all
  PRs and merged into `master`, and the service comments on PRs indicating any
  changes in coverage compared to the base branch.
* [ReadTheDocs][readthedocs]:  We ensure our documentation builds for all PRs,
  and the documentation is published for `master` and all release tags.
* [pre-commit.ci][precommitci]: We ensure all the `pre-commit` checks we
  encourage developers to run locally also run in CI.

[codecov]: https://about.codecov.io/
[readthedocs]: https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org
[precommitci]: https://pre-commit.ci/

### Merging

When the review is finished and changes are ready to be merged into `master`:
1. Rebase your feature branch on top of the latest `master`.
2. Clean up your branch with an interactive rebase, squashing down to the
   smallest number of commits that makes sense.  If there are successive
   distinct changes in a pull request, it's fine for those to be preserved in
   separate commits.
3. Notify your reviewers that the request is ready to merge.
4. Wait for them to merge the request.
5. Ensure the post-merge CI pipeline also succeeds.
